# FME

FME is a data integration platform that excels in spatial data manipulation. Workspaces allow the user to visually understand the workflow and customize with a drag and drop system. The examples provided are basic and only achieve connecting to the Data.gov.au API. However, they are a great base line that you can build upon to meet your requirments.
