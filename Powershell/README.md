# Microsoft Powershell

## 5.1+
By default Powershell 5.1 comes with Windows installations. As this version does not support Multipart form data the script builds its own and submits it with the request.

## 6.0+
From Powershell 6.0 onwards, WebRequest supports the submittion of Form data which helps in a much more simple development.
